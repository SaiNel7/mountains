Known as 'Sagarmatha' to the Nepalese and 'Chomolungma' to the Tibetans, this sacred peak has claimed over 300 lives while drawing thousands of climbers seeking to touch the roof of the world."

                    lore: "The 'Great Black' - named for its dark, rocky appearance. Makalu's pyramid shape and isolated location make it one of the most beautiful and challenging peaks. Its four-sided pyramid structure is unique among the eight-thousanders."

                    lore: "The 'Turquoise Goddess' - considered the easiest of the eight-thousanders due to its gentle slopes and stable weather. Cho Oyu serves as a training ground for climbers preparing for more challenging peaks like Everest."

                    lore: "The 'Mountain of the Spirit' - named after the Sanskrit word 'manas' meaning intellect or soul. Manaslu's remote location and technical challenges make it one of the least climbed eight-thousanders, preserving its pristine wilderness."

                    lore: "The 'Hidden Peak' - named for its secluded location in the Karakoram range. Gasherbrum I's remote position and technical climbing requirements make it one of the most challenging peaks to access and climb."

                    lore: "The 'Falchan Kangri' - its name means 'broad peak' due to its wide summit ridge. Located near K2, Broad Peak offers a slightly less technical alternative while still providing the challenge of high-altitude climbing."

                    lore: "The 'Crest Above the Grassy Plain' - the only eight-thousander entirely within Tibet. Shishapangma was the last of the fourteen to be climbed, and its location in Chinese territory made it inaccessible to Western climbers until the 1980s."
